# MachineLearning

This project is a personal project wherein I have attempted to implement various Machine Learning algorithms from scratch in Python/R. 

It also contains my attempts at some Data Analytics Competitions. The larger aim is to understand the workings of Machine Learning algorithms and their implementation so that I am able to use them better.
