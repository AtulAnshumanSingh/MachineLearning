# MachineLearning

This project is a personal project wherein I attempt to implement various Machine Learning algorithms from scratch in Python or R. I have put my attempts at various Data Analytics Competitions. The aim is to understand the workings of these algorithm and their implementation so that I am able to re-implement them according to the requirements for my projects.
