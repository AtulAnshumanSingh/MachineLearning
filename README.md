# Machine Learning

This project is a personal project wherein I have attempted to implement various Machine Learning algorithms from scratch in Python/R. 

It also contains my attempts at some Data Analytics Competitions. The larger aim is to understand the workings of Machine Learning algorithms and their implementation so that I am able to use them better. 

Following Algorithms have been implemented till now:

  1. <a href="https://github.com/AtulAnshumanSingh/MachineLearning/blob/master/Implementing%20Singular%20Value%20Decomposition%20algorithm%20with%20application%20to%20Linear%20Regression%20analysis.ipynb">Sigular Value Decomposition with applicaition to Linear Regression Analysis</a>
  
  2. <a href="https://github.com/AtulAnshumanSingh/MachineLearning/blob/master/Implementing%20Support%20Vector%20Machine.ipynb"> Support Vector Machines</a>
  
  3. <a href="https://github.com/AtulAnshumanSingh/MachineLearning/blob/master/Implementing%20Gradient%20Boosting%20Machine%20for%20Decision%20Tree%20Based%20Classifier.ipynb">Gradient Boosting Machine for Decision Tree Based Classifier</a>
